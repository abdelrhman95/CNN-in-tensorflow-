# CNN-in-tensorflow- 

through these notebooks you will how to implement :
1- Image Agumentation to avoid overfitting 
2- transfer learning (use a pretrained model instead of creating architecture from scratch)
3- Drop-Out (drop some layers to avoid overfitting)

these are a part of tensorflow speacialization https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice#about
